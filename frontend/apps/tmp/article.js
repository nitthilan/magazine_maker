    "title": "Famous Writersâ€™ Sleep Habits vs. Literary Productivity, Visualized | Brain Pickings",
    "description": " The early bird gets the Pulitzer â€¦ sort of. â€œIn both writing and sleeping,â€ Stephen King observed in his excellent meditation on the art of â€œcreative sleepâ€ and wakeful dreaming, â€œwe learn to be physically still at the same time we are encouraging our minds to unlock from the humdrum rational thinking of our daytime lives.â€ Over the years, in my endless fascination with daily routines, I found myself especially intrigued by successful writersâ€™ sleep habits â€” after all, itâ€™s been argued that â€œsleep is the best (and easiest) creative aphrodisiacâ€ and science tells us that it impacts everything from our moods to our brain development to our every waking moment. I found myself wondering whether there might be a correlation between sleep habits and literary productivity. The challenge, of course, is that data on each of these variables is hard to find, hard to quantify, or both. So I turned to Italian information designer Giorgia Lupi and her team at Accurat â€” who make masterful visualizations of cultural phenomena seemingly impossible to quantify â€” and, together, we set out to explore whether it might be possible to visualize such a correlation. First, I handed them my notes on writersâ€™ wake-up times, amassed over years of reading biographies, interviews, journals, and other materials. Many came from two books â€” Daily Rituals: How Artists Work by Mason Currey and Odd Type Writers: From Joyce and Dickens to Wharton and Welty, the Obsessive Habits and Quirky Techniques of Great Authors by Celia Blue Johnson â€” as well as from the Paris Review interviews and various collections of diaries and letters. We ended up with a roster of thirty-seven writers for whom wake-up times were available â€” this became the base data set, around which we set out to quantify, then visualize, the literary productivity of each author. One important caveat is that there is an enormous degree of subjectivity in assessing a literary â€” or any creative â€” career, but since all information visualization is an exercise in subjective editorial judgment rather than a record of Objective Truth, we settled on a set of quantifiable criteria to measure â€œproductivityâ€: number of published works and major awards received. Given that both the duration and the era of an authorâ€™s life affect literary output â€” longer lives offer more time to write, and some authors lived before the major awards were established â€” those variables were also indicated for context. \n\n\n\n\n\n Lastly, I reached out to Wendy MacNaughton â€” illustrator extraordinaire and very frequent collaborator â€” and asked her to contribute an illustrated portrait for each of the authors. The end result â€” a labor of love months in the making â€” is this magnificent visualization of the correlation between writersâ€™ wake-up times, displayed in clock-like fashion around each portrait, and their literary productivity, depicted as different-colored â€œaurasâ€ for each of the major awards and stack-bars for number of works published, color-coded for genre. The writers are ordered according to a â€œtimelineâ€ of earliest to latest wake-up times, beginning with Balzacâ€™s insomniac 1 A.M. and ending with Bukowskiâ€™s bohemian noon. The most important caveat of all, of course, is that there are countless factors that shape a writerâ€™s creative output, of which sleep is only one â€” so this isnâ€™t meant to indicate any direction of causation, only to highlight some interesting correlations: for instance, the fact that (with the exception of outliers who are both highly prolific and award-winning, such as like Bradbury and King) late risers seem to produce more works but win fewer awards than early birds. The most important point, perhaps, is a meta one: A reminder that no specific routine guarantees success, and the only thing that matters is having a routine and the persistence implicit to one. Showing up day in and day out, without fail, is the surest way to achieve lasting success. Pore over (click the image to zoom) and delight in drawing your own conclusions or merely in taking some voyeuristic enjoyment: \n\n\n\n\n\n The visualization is available as a gorgeous giclÃ©e print, with a third of the proceeds donated to literacy nonprofit Room to Read and the rest split between Accurat and Wendy.

    "description": " By Lakshmi Sivadas It was half past eleven at night. Suraj and Sahil, had ordered food from a nearby restaurant in Gurgaon. They got chatty with the delivery person. Soon, the two were at the restaurant, talking to the ownerâ€“ there was a problem they could solve! This was the beginning of Delhivery, a last mile logistics company which now employs over 3,200 people and handles over a lakh packages a day. â€œIt was 11.30 at night, I still remember, we took our bikes and went to meet the owner, Anuj Bajaj, who was surprisingly still there. He said he was shutting the restaurant down. He was really happy we had come because he wanted his staff to relocate somewhere. We said bring it on, weâ€™ll hire everybody,â€ narrates Sahil. In the course of conversation, they found out that the owner, Bajaj, also ran a cargo business. It didnâ€™t cross their minds that they would be seeing him again for a while. â€œA year down the line, when we realised that we needed cargo services, we went back to him and asked him to work with us. Today he is one of our largest vendors,â€ says Sahil. Sahil Barua was studying at IIM Bangalore when he decided on his first start-up. The idea did not really take flight. Their thesis was fairly simple, help other startups augment an operations team, a finance team and whatever was needed to scale their business. This was in early 2008. Sahil at Delhiveryâ€™s First Fulfillment Center â€œUnfortunately for us, when we were graduating in 2008, the economy went south. A part of the entire thesis of our original startup was that we would also be able to finance these startups. But we knew we wouldnâ€™t be able to do this anymore. So we settled on day jobs,â€ narrates Sahil Barua, co-founder, Delhivery. Suraj Saharan and Mohit Tandon were already working at the management consulting arm of Bain & Co in 2008 when Sahil joined the company. One of the things they had in common was that they wanted to start their own venture. â€œWe didnâ€™t have the faintest idea what we were going to do. We decided to quit on one fact, we realised there is only so much you can learn in consulting, and grow,â€ says Sahil. They took a six month sabbatical together. After the sabbatical and three years into their consulting jobs they decided to quit to start up. The three already had an interest in the internet space, and the numbers indicated that the growth would be staggering. It also helped that they were friends of Zomato co-founders Pankaj Chaddah and Deepinder Goyal. â€œWhen we started the business it was very simple, it was born out of several discussions with ChaddahÂ and Deepinder. Our question to them was look you guys are doing a fantastic business online, and presenting them to users. The next step is obviously to fulfill the order. Why has no one built a delivery network for restaurants? Thatâ€™s how the idea started with hyperlocal,â€ says Sahil. They started tying up with local restaurants and fulfilling their orders forÂ them in under half an hour. The Founding Team of Delhivery Sahil was out with his friends in 2008, when he was introduced to his soon-to-be co-founder, Bhavesh Manglani, an IIM-Kolkata graduate.Â â€œHe was introduced to me as a really interesting guy and a great techie. We exchanged numbers over dinner,â€ says Sahil, â€œWe didnâ€™t see or hear from each other for three years after that,â€ he adds. Three years down the line, after setting up Delhivery, they needed a person to fill the gap in the tech department. They had no luck.Â Sahil picked up his phone in one last attempt to see if somebody he knew would fit the role. â€œI was going through my phone book and came across Bhaveshâ€™s number. So I told these guys look thereâ€™s this person I know who is supposedly very good at technology, why donâ€™t I give him a call?â€ Bhavesh was working with Idea Cellular in Ahmedabad when he received the call. He was talking to Sahil after a long time. When he heard the plan for the startup he was on board immediately. When Bhavesh shifted to handling operations on the team, the 5th co-founder, Kapil Bharti replaced him in November 2011. They set up their first branch in a 250 sq ft room in Sushant Arcade, Gurgaon which was their corporate office, despatch centre, call centre, development centre all rolled into one. They were 10 people in all, including 4 delivery persons. Business was good for Delhivery. Soon, they were clocking in over 100 orders a day in Gurgaon.Â This was when their investor Abhishek Goyal set the ball rolling for them in the e-commerce space. â€œAbhishek said â€“ look if you can deliver food in half an hour, why donâ€™t you deliver packages for me as well? Seeing the progress, Prashant of Healthkart came on board and said why donâ€™t you deliver for us as well? It would be great if it would reach customers in half an hour after they ordered them,â€ narrates Sahil. Thatâ€™s when they noticed that this business was win-win not only for them and the e-commerce companies, but also customers who were now happy to receive parcels on time.Â â€œWe started appearing on blogs, and thatâ€™s when we thought â€“ hang on, why is this space so interesting? Why is Blue Dart not able to do what weâ€™re doing?â€ says Sahil. To understand the space, Suraj and he began testing the waters and thereby future competitors. They started sending packages to each other using the different delivery services. They ordered a number of products online to understand where the delivery networks had their focus. They soon realised that the problem was that the traditional delivery partners had not understood the scope of e-commerce entirely. They also did not understand that e-commerce delivery was fundamentally different from traditional delivery, explains Sahil. â€œThatâ€™s when we said â€“ e-commerce is a gigantic opportunity, why donâ€™t we go after this and come back to hyperlocal later? Thatâ€™s how we made the transition,â€ he says. The Growing Delhivery Team By the end of December 2011,they were delivering over 500 shipments a day for 5 e-commerce clients in the Delhi NCR region. Their team size had grown to 25, and they also launched their second and third centres in Malviya Nagar and Janakpuri and started servicing all of Delhi-NCR.Â In September 2013, Delhivery raised nearly $5 mn from Nexus Venture Partners in a series B funding round. â€œWhen we started out we had problems because people said you guys will go out of business. Then along the way people started saying they will do logistics in-house, then they said you guys are expensive and we have cheaper options,â€ explains Sahil. Whatâ€™s the best way to get a customer? Go to people and ask them to try your product out. â€œWalk up to them and ask them what problem theyâ€™re facing. See if you can solve it for them. IndiaTimes was not happy with whom they were working for at the time and wanted someone who can deliver in 24 hours. We said weâ€™ll do it for them. Thatâ€™s how they signed up the account,â€ says Sahil talking about Times Internet (also their investor) e-commerce venture in India. Delhivery asked them to start with a risk of 30 packages a day. If they could deliver 30 packages, then increase it to 50 and keep increasing it to test their limit. For the first year and a half of business, Delhivery walked up to clients and asked them to try the product free of charge for a month. They also gave potential clients 30 packages a day free just to get them to try the product. â€œWe knew nothing about this space. All we knew is that we need a couple of things â€“ a distribution centre, an IT platform and you need guys on bikes to deliver this,â€ narrates Sahil.Â They met brokers and hunted for real estate. â€œWe had many parameters to satisfy â€“ it should be 500 sq ft, it should be located on the ground floor, it should be either on the ring road, and it shouldnâ€™t cost more than 15K a month. When we put all the parameters together, you found there were zero properties. So we went back to the drawing board to see which we were willing to relax,â€ narrates Sahil. However, with whatever knowledge they possessed on distribution centres, they eventually they found them. Kapil, Delhiveryâ€™s tech head, focussed entirely on building Delhiveryâ€™s IT system. He talked to various customers to understand what they wanted from Delhivery, and what they lacked. Thereafter, he and his team, built the IT system from scratch. â€œWeâ€™ve learnt so much from doing this. Weâ€™ve started branches in wrong locations, our initial network design was implemented, and we realised it was completely wrong within a month. We started with reverse logistics two and a half years ago, but we didnâ€™t anticipate the problems that would arise when customers donâ€™t package products when they return it. We were literally stuck with half a slipper, t-shirts and other products in our centre. We failed, but when we started again we learnt the hard way. We had our own packaging and now itâ€™s far more efficient. â€œWhatever kind of business you are doing â€“ restaurant delivery, e-commerce whatever it is, technology makes all the difference. Make sure you have that in focus all the time.â€ â€œWeâ€™ve re-invented the wheel a lot of times, and what youâ€™ll find is that sometimes the process of re-inventing is more important than the wheel itself. In management weâ€™re taught never to do this, but as an entrepreneur itâ€™s always best if you do.â€ Hereâ€™s wishing them a great journey ahead. Meet the most amazing startupâ€™s, learn from their journey and build your inner circle. It all begins at UnPluggd, our startup conference scheduled for 24 May at Bangalore. \n    \n    \n    \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n \n    Email *\n    \n    \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n Select list(s):  Daily Newsletter  Weekly Newsletter  Copyright Â© 2009-2014 NextBigWhat.com",

    "title": "Static Site Generators for Building Websites & Blogs | CodeCondo",
    "description": "  You shouldnâ€™t be spending too much time on building simple, static websites and blogs, especially if youâ€™re a developer who needs to publish frequent updates, you crave the ability to save time. Iâ€™m not sure when exactly the first static site generators started to appear, but I know itâ€™s not a really long time, as back in 2006 â€“ I couldnâ€™t even dream of being able to generate a website from a .txt file, instantly. Not to mention, have that website look good and appealing. While the majority of the world depends on CMS platforms like WordPress, there is an ever growing market of those designers and developers who simply need a website, or a blog, that works and doesnâ€™t require more than 128MB of ram to run. The average WordPress installation these days requires a minimum of 1GB ram, to be efficient, fast and reliable. The downside? Well, there arenâ€™t really that many downsides to having a static website, for one â€“ youâ€™re learning how to use markdown, youâ€™re learning how to deploy a static website, and most of all â€“ youâ€™re learning how to work with other content systems, some of which are used by big outlets and companies you already know of. The biggest cons are probably the need to implement 3rd party services for things like dynamic content, or comments. Beyond that, itâ€™s very hard to see why you shouldnâ€™t be using a static website. Is the admin dashboard really all that important, when you could focus much more on the content instead? Iâ€™m going to take a look at the seven most popular static website generators that you can begin using right now, theyâ€™re all frequently updated, have great communities behind them â€“ and as I just mentioned above, some of the top websites in the world use them, so thereâ€™s definitely some sort of value.  Jekyll, very simple and user friendly static website / blog generator, has been downloaded nearly 700,000 times and is powered by the ever lovely Ruby. Yes, it does mean youâ€™ll need to learn how to install Ruby gems, but thatâ€™s barely an issue. Why? If youâ€™re a DigitalOcean customer, youâ€™ll know that theyâ€™ve got a really nice tutorial section â€“ see some of the WordPress tutorials here â€“ which is full of guides and walk-throughs for getting started with Ruby. Best of all, those tutorials are universal, and will work with any other hosting provider. Just to give you a glimpse of the power of Jekyll, the official GitHub Pages are powered by this platform, and every single one of the GitHubâ€™s pages that developers have built and designed are powered by Jekyll. As you know, GitHub is one of the biggest programming websites in the world, so I guess it does account for something, and gives Jekyll the right credibility. Itâ€™s very easy to get started with, and you can also see some example sites built for personal portfolio purposes / general blogging.  Iâ€™m having a hard time putting this in perspective, probably because itâ€™s so simple. Octopress will take away all the difficulties of having to generate your own HTML / Markup that Jekyll might present. Itâ€™s a web framework specifically designed for Jekyll, to make building sites even more easy, by implementing the use of script generators. While Jekyll is great, Octopress gives us more flexibility, and itâ€™s worth noting that itâ€™s not a library, but a repository, which makes code styling that much easier for those who want to â€˜play aroundâ€™. Itâ€™s incredibly easy to fine tune the code to your own needs, almost like working with a .txt file â€“ full of text that needs sorting to be readable. Although the Jekyll documentation is good, Octopressâ€™ sample configuration files are really much easier to comprehend than by referencing the Jekyll wiki. So, it was clear that Octopress would make it much easier to manage your Jekyll website, not harder. [...] Now, if you really need some further inspiration, and want real-life examples, take a look at the official list of sites using Octopress, it will certainly give you a better perspective on what can be done with this blog / site generator platform.  Empower your website frontends with layouts, meta-data, pre-processors (markdown, jade, coffeescript, etc.), partials, skeletons, file watching, querying, and an amazing plugin system. Use it either standalone, as a build script, or even as a module in a bigger system. Either way, DocPad will streamline your web development process allowing you to craft full-featured websites quicker than ever before. [...] Itâ€™s built on Node.js, and is totally awesome! It comes integrated with an administrator dashboard, to make publishing easier and more timely, without taking away all of the simplicity from front-end development. I recommend checking out my web application frameworks for Node.js post to learn more about whatâ€™s possible to build using Node.js! I just want to say that DocPad also takes away all of the â€˜mega-simplicityâ€™ that the first two static site generators presented, and instead provides a much more sophisticated experience, with features like internal plugin features that allow to extend the functionality of this framework â€“ drastically. For getting started, I recommend the following YouTube video series, which will walk you through the process of learning about DocPad, and also building a simple blog with it. Itâ€™s definitely worth looking more into DocPad, quite a few people are using this static site (blog) generator already, and the feedback is really nice. Youâ€™ll find that itâ€™s also easy to setup, if you follow the video tutorials I linked above, they might be lengthy â€“ but you only have to watch them once.  Open-source static site publishing tool. Supports Markdown and reST-formatted content. Powered by Python. Itâ€™s possibly one of the simplest ones on the list, and there isnâ€™t a whole lot to discuss about it, not even terms of features, as everything is printed out on the homepage of this static site generator. I recommend heading over to Javierâ€™s site, and reading his rad tutorial on how to get started with Pelican. I promise, itâ€™s quick and easy.  Building static sites shouldnâ€™t be looked at as something that people did back in 1995, you should think of static websites and blogs as an huge advancement in technology. Itâ€™s funny to watch the trend go from huge content management systems, back to small sites â€“ hosted on servers with 200MBish ram, letting traffic the size of HN news front-page to pass through. Middleman is a ruby gem, just like Jekyll is, and so youâ€™ll need to know / learn how to deploy. Head back to the top to see the links I provided to make it happen. Middleman itself covers quite a bit â€“  SAAS, LESS, HTML5 templates and much more. It even has a sophisticated template directory to browse from. Chris Bell â€“ a Ruby fanatic, has built / written a tutorial on how to get started with Middleman, and how to build your first blog / website. Heâ€™s going in-depth about some of the styling options, and itâ€™s far better than anything I could produce. See the tutorial here.  Flexible, minimalistic, multi-platform static site generator built on top of node.js. The really great thing about Wintersmith is the ease of developing / launching a new site, it can be literally done with a single command line command. wintersmith new [site-name] Youâ€™ll get a default installation containing all of the necessary config files, templating files and much more, the whole ecosystem to put in perspective. Itâ€™s also very plugin friendly. But, I think the biggest feature to mention here is that itâ€™s not built just for static websites or blogs, it seems to stretch much further than that!  Whether youâ€™re new to Wintersmith, or have built sites with it before, itâ€™s worth taking a look at David Tuckerâ€™s two-part series on how Wintersmith works, and how easy it is to deploy new websites with it.  Itâ€™s another one thatâ€™s written in Ruby, I can almost see a trend forming here, but gladly â€“ this is the last static site generator weâ€™re going to add to our list, before wrapping it up. I think it was easy to notice how the list started to shrink by the end of it. nanoc is a tool for building static web sites. It can transform content from one format (e.g. Haml or Markdown) into another (usually HTML) and lay out pages so that the siteâ€™s look and feel is consistent across all pages. Youâ€™ll find that nanoc is great for building both personal and magazine blogs, photography galleries for photographers, and even portfolio websites for agencies and corporate companies. Itâ€™s flexible, makes it easy to integrate with other Ruby frameworks and platforms, allows the implementation of plugins and is not very hard to style. If youâ€™re looking for a static site generator that enables the ability to build in multiple languages, nanoc might be your best choice. You can learn more why at their multilingual section. I think it doesnâ€™t really matter, whether youâ€™re focusing on hosting a huge website, or a simple portfolio, static websites can be extremely useful when it comes to saving money, time and resources. Iâ€™m certain there are enormous amounts of reports on how people find static websites far better, than a full-scale content management system, some of these even offer dynamic content integration â€“ so itâ€™s not that big of a deal. Building a static site through these generators can mean only one thing, youâ€™re after simplicity and want to put the emphasis on the content, which is what you should be doing. Iâ€™m in the process of building my first static website for one of my projects, and I canâ€™t wait to experiment, hopefully even build a report in the future. So, my question is this â€“ which of these services are you using and what has been your own experience with building a static website, application or a blog? What can you recommend to those who might need help with taking their first steps? cover photo by sap +1 for nanoc, I havenâ€™t really played much with others, but nanoc approach to static sites is pretty neat, and allows quite a lot of flexibility. The only issue Iâ€™ve had with nanoc is that pagination is quite a mess Iâ€™ve been pretty impressed by Pelican so far. Its command line interfaces are very user friendly. I have been spending a couple of weekends looking at SSGs to replace some  WordPress blogs. My order of personal preference so far is â€“ pelican (python), hugo (go), octopress (ruby), and then wintersmith (coffeescript). I tried running some of them on Windows with CYGWIN and MINGW frameworks.  I found Hugo and Pelican worked the best on Windows. Ruby just not agree with Windows without patching the SSGs and wasting time. I shortlisted middleman (it had bug at time of review), nanoc (because i noticed a lot of people moving away to the other platforms), docpad (too much flexibility to shoot myself in the foot with), and hexo (very popular and lots of themes/templates but it uses EJS templating which does not get good reviews).

    "title": "BBC News - Nutella: How the world went nuts for a hazelnut spread",
    "description": "  For a better experience on your device, try our mobile site. Nutella, the nutty chocolate spread, is turning 50. Last year some 365 million kilos were consumed - roughly the weight of the Empire State Building - in 160 countries around the world. Half a century ago, in a small town in northern Italy, this would have been unimaginable. In the hungry months after the end of World War Two, a young confectioner has a vision - of an affordable luxury made of a small amount of cocoa and lots of hazelnuts. His name: Pietro Ferrero. \"My grandfather lived to find this formula. He was completely obsessed by it,\" says the current boss of the family business, Giovanni Ferrero. \"He woke up my grandmother at midnight -  she was sleeping - and he made her taste it with spoons, asking, 'How was it?' and 'What do you think?'\"  The way the family tells the story, it's a modern fairytale. Pietro was a humble man who lived in an enchanting region famed throughout the land for its delicious and abundant hazelnuts. Times were hard and chocolatey delights were not for the common people. Still, he dreamed of a magic formula that would enable everyone to enjoy his sweet treats. There's a happy ending, too. Ferrero's tiny business in the picturesque town of Alba goes on to become the fourth most important international group in the chocolate confectionery market, with an annual turnover of more than 8bn euros (Â£6.5bn; $11bn). When Pietro had his vision, the Piedmont region of Italy, and its capital Turin, was already famed for its chocolate industry. It was the birthplace of Gianduja, a creamy combination of chocolate and hazelnuts. But only the rich could think of buying it. \"Chocolate was so expensive, it was really high-end, nobody could afford it, at least in Italy,\" says Giovanni Ferrero. But in 1946 his grandfather launched Giandujot, or Pasta Gianduja. Produced as loaves wrapped in aluminium foil, it was a sort of solidified Nutella that had to be cut with a knife. The first spreadable version - Supercrema - came a few years later. \"This was a big success,\" says Giovanni. \"It was the first brand that allowed people to enjoy confectionery at a very accessible price, even if it was not fully confectionery. This is how everything started.\"  Spreadability meant that a small amount went a long way, helping to break down the perception that chocolate was, as Giovanni puts it, \"only for very special occasions and celebrations like Christmas and Easter\". It could also be eaten with bread, which formed a big part of the diet at the time. People who never ate chocolate got the Supercrema habit. But it was Pietro's son, Michele Ferrero, who turned it into Nutella, relaunching it with its now famously secret recipe and iconic glass jar. His father was a man obsessed, says Giovanni, just like his grandfather. \"My father said, 'We can push it further, there are new technologies, there are new ways to integrate this winning recipe,'\" he says. \"Nutella was born the same year as I was born, 1964, so I have a small brother in the family! And it was not just an Italian success but a European success.\" The name gave the product instant international appeal. It said nuts. It also said Italy - \"-ella\" being a common affectionate or diminutive ending in Italian, as in mozzarella (cheese), tagliatella (a form of pasta), or caramella (Italian for a sweet). Fifty years on, Nutella is a global phenomenon, produced in 11 factories worldwide, and accounting for one fifth of the Ferrero Group's turnover, along with other products such as Kinder and Ferrero Rocher chocolates. The company is the number one user of hazelnuts in the world, buying up 25% of the entire world production. But how did one brand of hazelnut chocolate spread manage to creep its way into so many kitchen cupboards for a full five decades? Roberta Sassatelli, associate professor of cultural sociology at Milan University and author of Consumer Culture, says initially Nutella was the epitome of a \"pop lux\" (popular luxury) for Italians. \"Nutella was something above average, something which was not a necessity,\" she says. \"It was something very sweet and modern and different from the classic sweets in Italyâ€¦ So, to Italians it meant both modernity and the possibility of giving yourself a treat.\" Both characteristics are embodied in its glass jar, with a \"traditional and luxurious\" shape, yet a plastic cap that is \"modern, cheap and functional\". The marketing of Nutella, Sassatelli says, has been a triumph. \"They never sold it as a surrogate, and this was very clever. They could have played on different universal values like, 'This is cheap, this is affordable, this can substitute chocolate.' No, they played upon,'This is natural, it contains nuts so it's better than those that don't contain them.'\" The images used to sell Nutella have tended to relate to children and family, she says - it may be an indulgence, but it's presented as the opposite of dangerous or decadent. \"It allows you little forms of transgression. It's a spread so you can dirty yourself a bit, but it's just for fun. I think that in the course of the history of Nutella, this is something which has been played on a lot - Nutella as a 'polite transgression'.\" The company has been particularly good at marketing Nutella as a good ingredient for a nutritious breakfast, Sassatelli says, emphasising the hazelnuts and milk rather than the high content of sugar and saturated fat. It is in fact nearly 57% sugar and 32% fat - and about a third of the fat is saturated. \"We all want our kids to have a balanced breakfast,\" said an advertisement in the UK in 2008, adding that each 400g jar contained 52 hazelnuts, the equivalent of a glass of skimmed milk and some cocoa. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled it exaggerated the spread's nutritional value. But three years later, the ASA gave a clean bill of health to another ad urging people to \"Wake up to Nutella\", and continuing: \"Each 15g portion contains two whole hazelnuts, some skimmed milk and cocoa.\" Nutella's three-year sponsorship of the national football team, starting in 1998, was a masterstroke, Sassatelli says. \"On the one hand, this links Nutella with the Italian national sentiment. On the other hand, of course, it links it with the idea that, in the right quantities, it is healthy to the point that even athletes use it.\"  Health issues will be far from the minds of Nutella fans taking part in this weekend's 50th birthday celebrations, which include a street party on Saturday in Ferrero's home town of Alba and a free concert on Sunday featuring pop star Mika in Naples' Piazza del Plebiscito. Among passionate fans celebrating Nutella's half century (and his own) is, of course, Giovanni Ferrero, although he admits its precise birthday is something of a mystery. \"Legend tells us that the first jar was manufactured out of the factory 50 years ago on 20 April and the first act of consumption was the 18 May,\" he says. \"But there's no scientific evidence!\" He says he loves not only the taste, but also the \"sweet memories\" of his childhood. His parents allowed him to eat Nutella at breakfast, and he now allows his own two sons to do the same. The Ferreros, he says, are a family with an \"intergenerational sweet tooth\".

    "title": "World War I in Photos: Animals at War - The Atlantic",
    "description": " Animals were used in World War I on a scale never before seen -- and never again repeated. Horses by the millions were put in service as cavalry mounts and beasts of burden, but they were not the only animals active in the war. Mules, dogs, camels, and pigeons all played vital roles, as well as many others -- all at great risk, and with heavy cost.  When the war began, Europe's armies had an understanding of warfare that put the use of cavalry in high regard. Soon, however, the deadly terrain that evolved around trench warfare rendered cavalry attacks nearly useless on the Western Front. But the need for constant resupply, movement of new heavy weaponry, and the transport of troops demanded horse power on a massive scale -- automobiles, tractors, and trucks were relatively new inventions and somewhat rare. British and French forces imported horses from colonies and allies around the world, a near-constant flow of hundreds of thousands of animals across the oceans, headed for war. One estimate places the number of horses killed during the four years of warfare at nearly 8 million. Other animals proved their usefulness as well: Dogs became messengers, sentries, rescuers, and small beasts of burden. Pigeons acted as messenger carriers, and even (experimentally) as aerial reconnaissance platforms. Mules and camels were drafted into use in various war theatres, and many soldiers brought along mascots to help boost morale. Only a couple of decades later, at the onset of World War II, most military tasks assigned to animals were done by machines, and warfare would never again rely so heavily on animal power. On this 100-year anniversary, I've gathered photographs of the Great War from dozens of collections, some digitized for the first time, to try to tell the story of the conflict, those caught up in it, and how much it affected the world. Today's entry is part 4 of a 10-part series on World War I, which will be posted every Sunday until June 29.

    "title": "A good, old-fashioned story - The Hindu",
    "description": " \nThere was a time when bookstores were filled with campus love stories set in IIT and IIM campuses. Chetan Bhagatâ€™s Five Point Someone â€“ What not to do at IIT (2004) spawned many campus capers until readers were fatigued by the genre and the stories had little recall value.  \nAround the same time, there was a quiet wave as Ashok Bankerâ€™s Ramayana series caught readersâ€™ attention. The text de-mystified the epic. From Prince of Ayodhya (2003) to Ramayana series: The Complete Omnibus (2013) and Mahabharata series from 2011 to 2014, Ashok Banker was the go-to author for mythology retellings. Much later, Amish Tripathi presented a cocktail of fantasy and mythology in his Shiva Trilogy series. Ashwin Sanghi took references from mythological and historical texts and set them in contemporary thrillers (The Chanakyaâ€™s Chant and The Krishna Key).  \nKrishna Udayashankarâ€™s Aryavarta Chronicles series is a reconstruction of the Mahabharata. V. Raviâ€™s The Exiled Prince blends Ramayana with science fiction while Anand Neelakantanâ€™s Asura and Ajaya narrate the epics from the point of view of the vanquished. Most of these works are by professionals turned authors, bound by a common interest in Indian mythology.  \nâ€œRavana is considered a scholar and a Shiva bhakth (devotee) in our puranas, apart from being a powerful emperor. A question that haunted me since childhood is why such a man is hated so much? What if Ravana had a different Ramayana to tell? Asura is an attempt to tell Ravanaâ€™s Ramayana,â€ says Anand Neelakantan.  \nBefore he became a bestselling author, he wrote columns and contributed cartoons besides his work at Indian Oil Corporation.  \nAsura also presents Bhadra as another hero and as Neelakantan says, â€œis the tale of the forgotten as much as it is the tale of the vanquishedâ€. Simultaneously, Neelakantan began work on his second book Ajaya, presenting Mahabharata from Duryodhanaâ€™s perspective.  \nFuturistic view \n \nData consultant and entrepreneur-turned-author V. Ravi found it easier to explain mythical happenings with relative science. â€œIt is critical to have our stories blend futuristic science that gives us a huge leeway into innovations ahead,â€ he says.  \nKrishna Udayashankar, an academic and a Ph.D holder in strategic management, began with a satirical retelling of Mahabharata only to give up midway. â€œI abandoned the satirical retelling and began reconstructing the epic because, trying to reconcile a characterâ€™s actions with the way events progress was next to impossible without looking for explanations. Itâ€™s easy to slot people into good and bad and justify all that they do. But real people are complicated,â€ she says.  \nResponse from readers has been encouraging, so far. â€œMany readers have got back to me saying I have brought to life the imaginary version of the Mahabharata in their minds, or tell me that I have provided possible answers to questions theyâ€™ve always had,â€ says Krishna.  \nThe audience is ready for new settings; it is for the author to connect with them, feels Neelakantan. â€œThese stories have been around for thousands of years. Great writers of the yore, from Bhasa to Kalidasa of the classical age, from Michael Madhusudhan Dutta, Shivaji Sawant, M.T. Vasudevan Nair, S.L. Bhyrappa and others in recent times, have reinterpreted the epics in their own style,â€ he says and draws an analogy to popular cinema. â€œWho can forget the portrayal of NTR or Shivaji Ganesan in their mythological films? The present trend we are witnessing in Indian English is a continuation of the same tradition,â€ he points out.  \nThe mythological characters in these books are not black and white and this reinterpretation is akin to walking on a razorâ€™s edge. â€œThe idea of â€˜super heroesâ€™ was to push people to raise the bar. The story doesnâ€™t change; you can make Ravana a CEO of a multi-billion dollar international corporation and Rama a rural farmer. The tale sells for an improbable victory of a primitive man over a powerful one,â€ reasons Ravi.  \nNew perspectives \n \nKrishna feels it is insightful to see new perspectives and shades to mythical characters we think we know. â€œSuch novelty is essential to keep the reader engaged. But the truth is also that characters are where the scope for fictionalisation comes in, particularly if one wants to tell the same old story all over again, without questioning the logic or motive for events. An author can tell the story of a time, or of a person. The latter is much easier, and certainly less offensive,â€ she explains.  \nMythological fiction might be occupying prime space on book shelves and a few bestselling authors maybe given lucrative sums for their next books, but is an inescapable dÃ©jÃ  vu creeping in? â€œUnless a book has an original philosophy and something unique to offer, these tales cannot evolve in a fast-paced world,â€ feels Ravi. Neelakantan feels these trends cannot be wished away. â€œThe books were not written to satisfy a trend but because the authors were passionate about what they wanted to say. When I started writing Asura eight years back, the trend was romantic comedy. It took me six years to finish my book and by that time, three trends had come and gone. A good story, well told, will always buck the trend irrespective of the genre,â€ he says.  \nQuality of writing \n \nKrishna sounds a note of caution: â€œMy concern is with the lack of quality in the genre, rather than the number of works. Mythology, Indian epics in particular, is far too rich to have been exhausted so quickly. If readers become less enthusiastic about the genre, it has to do more with the quality of writing and not the concepts,â€ she points out.  \nReading list \n \nAnand Neelakantanâ€™s Asura and Ajaya \n \nKrishna Udayashankarâ€™s The Aryavarta Chronicles  \nV.

This movie is not terrible, but very cheesy and extremely predictable. Much like the recent faith-based movies all the problems in this movie seemed to be solved way to easy. To me a movie without a real push back against the lead actor seems boring and too cookie cutter like. While I can't really say anything bad about this movie because I did like it, I can't really say anything really good about it either because ten minutes in I could tell how it would end. That makes a movie boring to me. Overall, not a bad movie and if you like this kind of thing you will really enjoy it.

    "title": "The McCartney Recording Sessions",
    "description": "  \n\n1972\n\n Â  These two songs were recorded at EMI Studios in London:  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -That same week and before leaving for the University tour on the 9th, the \nband rehearsed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. These \nrehearsals were filmed and the only songs we know of that were performed are (in \norder): Lucille, The Mess (several takes), \nSeaside Woman (2 takes), Give Ireland Back To The Irish, \nBip Bop, Wild Life, My Love, Blue Moon \nof Kentucky and Maybellene. Â  Â   -an alternate mix of this was released in Germany. Â  Â  Sessions for the Red Rose Speedway album were recorded at the \nfollowing London studios: Morgan, Olympic, Trident, Island, A.I.R. and EMI. The \nsongs recorded during this time are: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Get On The Right Thing, Little Lamb Dragonfly \nand I Lie Around were brought out of the vaults and \nworked on a bit as well. At this point, Bridge On The River Suite \nmerely consisted of Paul's acoustic guitar part. The unknown instrumental piano \nbased song was recorded during the November sessions and can be heard at the \nstart of the radio commercial promoting Hi Hi Hi. \nReportedly a jam of C Moon from Sept. 3rd with John Bonham of Led \nZeppelin is said to exist but more definitely, a non-reggae alternate version of \nthe same track does exist. Also sitting in the vaults from this time is an all \nacoustic first take of One More Kiss. Â  Red Rose Speedway was originally conceived as a double album. The following \ntracklisting is taken from the double acetate dated Dec.13 1972: Side 1: \nBig Barn Bed\nMy Love\nWhen The Night\nSingle Pigeon\n\nSide 2:\nTragedy\nMama's Little Girl\nLoup (1st Indian On The Moon)\nI Would Only Smile \n\nSide 3: \nCountry Dreamer\nNight Out\nOne More Kiss\nJazz Street \n\nSide 4: \nI Lie Around\nLittle Lamb Dragonfly\nGet On The Right Thing\n1882\nThe Mess I'm In Â Â Â  -notice the omission of the medley. 1882 and The Mess I'm \nIn (as it was titled on the LP) were both the live versions from the \nAugust tour. I Would Only Smile is re-recording of a 1967 Denny \nLaine song. Â  Â  A little tune called Complain To The Queen was \nimprovised during an Amsterdam Interview. Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -this was recorded \nlive at The Hague, Netherlands on August 21. Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -this was recorded live in \nAntwerp, Belgium. When this  version was planned to be released on the '87 edition of Cold Cuts, \nit was renamed to Why Do You Treat Me So Bad. Â  Sometime this year, Paul decided to record another demo for \nA Love For You even though the song had already \nbeen recorded in 1970 during the Ram sessions. Â  Â ",
